# Play as Being Apps

## Overview
[Play as Being Basic Ideas](https://wiki.playasbeing.org/About_PlayAsBeing/Basic_Ideas)

The app allows a person to check in at or close to a 15-minute boundary, at which time there is a 9-second _drop_. The app lists (any) other participants in the drop.

This was first implemented as a script for DekiWiki, the platform for the PaB wiki.

It was pushed here to GitHub on 2011-02-09: 9secs app - copied from wiki.playasbeing.org.

2019: A pure Javascript implementation of the core functionality will reside here.
